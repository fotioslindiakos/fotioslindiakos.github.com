I don't know what it is about celebrating a birthday that makes me want to be able to go back and reflect on the past year.
I realize that right around this time last year I made a feeble attempt at starting a blog, but never got off the ground.
It was probably due to the fact that, like this time, I spent most of the initial energy trying to get something that looked halfway decent.
Last time, there was almost no bootstrapping process, so I failed hard and fast.
Hopefully this time, since I at least have something basic to work with, I will keep up with it.
My goal is to capture and share things I learn at work, and things I learn/experience at life.
Only time will tell....
